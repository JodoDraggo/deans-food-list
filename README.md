Description:
  Shopping list web app creating in React.js, utilizing Express.js for the backend, MySQL for the database.
  Reactive (automatically adapts to any screen size/ratio/resolution) web app that meets a real customer's specific requirements.

Intention: senior school project simulating a real work environment with a real customer.
  The customer, Dean, had many requirements for his grocery app.
  Through trial and error, we got most of his requirements implemented within the provided 15-week (8-26-2024 - 12-2-2024) window.
  However, we barely got in the functionality in time, leaving us no time to make it look pretty, thus our demo lacked CSS for advanced features (such as the checklist). Regardless, we achieved an 'A'.
  Post-graduation I, Jonah Raef, maintained an itch to complete the project and bring it to its projected glory. I have implmented the CSS and gotten the app to meet the customer's requirements list.
  In addition, a demo is available on the "Big-I" Internet, viewable here:
