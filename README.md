Intention: senior school project simulating a real work environment with a real customer.
  The customer, Dean, had many requirements for his grocery app.
  Through trial and error, we got most of his requirements implemented within the provided 15-week (8-26-2024 - 12-2-2024) window. Understanding the time constraints, he was very happy with   what we implmeneted in the tight timeframe - achieving us an 'A'.
  Post-graduation I, Jonah Raef, maintained an itch to complete the project and bring it to its projected glory. I have implmented the CSS and gotten the app to meet the customer's 
  remaining requirements. 
  In addition, a demo is available on the "Big-I" Internet, viewable here: deansfoodlist.ddns.net
